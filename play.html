            bell_.] </p>  <p class=" speech"> It is a great nuisance.  I can’t find any one in this house to
                talk to.  And I am full of interesting information.  I feel like the
                latest edition of something or other.</p>

        <h4 class="name james">JAMES</h4> <p class=" speech "> Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir
            Robert.  I told him your lordship was here.</p>
        
        <h4 class=" name goring ">LORD GORING</h4> <p class=" speech "> Thank you!  Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?</p>

        <h4 class=" name goring ">LORD GORING</h4> <p class=" speech "> Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
            It is a great deal too much excitement for any son.  I hope to goodness
            he won’t come up.  Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.  That is the
            only proper basis for family life.  Mothers are different.  Mothers are
            darlings.  </p> <p class=" stage-direction">[_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and

        <h4 class=" name caversham ">LORD CAVERSHAM</h4>  <p class=" speech ">Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time
            as usual, I suppose?</p>
        
        <h4 class=" name goring ">LORD GORING</h4> <p class=" stage-direction "> [_Throws down paper and rises_.]</p>  <p class=" speech ">My dear father, when one
            pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
            one’s own.</p>
        
        <h4 class=" name caversham ">LORD CAVERSHAM</h4> <p class=" speech "> Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
            last night?</p>
        
        <h4 class=" name goring ">LORD GORING</h4> <p class=" speech "> I have been thinking about nothing else.</p>

        <h4 class=" name goring ">LORD GORING</h4> <p class=" stage-direction "> [_Genially_.]</p> <p class=" speech "> Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.</p>

            would be of any convenience to you.</p>
        
        <h4 class=" name goring ">LORD GORING</h4> <p class=" speech "> Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
            lunch.</p>
        
        <h4 class=" name caversham ">LORD CAVERSHAM</h4>  <p class=" speech ">Humph!  Never know when you are serious or not.</p>
